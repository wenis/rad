# Contributing to RAD System

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Rapid Agile Development (RAD) System! This document provides guidelines for contributing.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

- **Check existing issues** first to avoid duplicates
- **Use issue templates** when creating new issues
- **Be specific** - Include error messages, steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior
- **Environment details** - Claude Code version, OS, project type

### Suggesting Features

- **Open a discussion** before implementing major features
- **Explain the use case** - Why is this needed? Who benefits?
- **Consider alternatives** - What other approaches were considered?
- **Check alignment** - Does this fit the RAD philosophy (speed + quality)?

### Pull Requests

**Before submitting:**
1. Test your changes thoroughly
2. Update relevant documentation
3. Follow the code style (see below)
4. Write a clear PR description

**PR Title Format:**
Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
```

```

**PR Description Template:**
```markdown

## Development Guidelines

### Adding a New Skill

1. **Create skill directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir .claude/skills/my-skill-name
   ```

2. **Create SKILL.md** following this template:
   ```markdown
   ---
   name: my-skill-name
   description: Brief description of what this skill does and when to use it
   allowed-tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep
   ---

   # Skill Name

   You [description of what the skill does].

   ## When to use
   - Use case 1
   - Use case 2

   ## Instructions
   1. Step 1
   2. Step 2

   ## Examples
   [Detailed examples with code]

   ## Best Practices
   ‚úÖ DO: [recommendations]
   ‚ùå DON'T: [anti-patterns]

   ## Constraints
   - [Requirements and limitations]
   ```

3. **Test the skill:**
   - Invoke it manually to verify it works
   - Test integration with relevant agents
   - Verify documentation is clear

4. **Update documentation:**
   - Add skill to README.md skills list
   - Update skill count in documentation
   - Add usage examples if helpful

### Modifying Agents

**Be careful when modifying agent prompts** - they're the core of the workflow.

**Testing changes:**
1. Run `/rapid-dev` on a test feature
2. Verify agent reads correct context files
3. Check that output artifacts are created correctly
4. Ensure feedback loop still works

**Key principles:**
- Agents must read `docs/SYSTEM.md` FIRST
- Agents should read `docs/CONVENTIONS.md` if it exists
- Maintain backwards compatibility where possible
- Document breaking changes clearly

### Modifying Commands

**Slash commands** orchestrate the workflow.

**Testing changes:**
1. Run the command manually
2. Verify it invokes correct agents
3. Check output is user-friendly
4. Ensure error handling works

### Documentation Standards

**README files:**
- Keep concise and scannable
- Include examples
- Update TOC if adding sections
- Use proper markdown formatting

**Agent/Skill prompts:**
- Clear "When to use" section
- Detailed instructions
- Concrete examples
- Best practices and constraints

**Code comments:**
- Explain *why*, not *what*
- Use markdown in .md files
- Keep formatting consistent

## Code Style

**Markdown files:**
- Use `#` for h1, `##` for h2, etc.
- Use `**bold**` and `*italic*` sparingly
- Code blocks with language hints: \`\`\`typescript
- Lists with `-` for unordered, `1.` for ordered
- Keep line length reasonable (< 120 chars)

**File naming:**
- Skill names: `kebab-case` (e.g., `tdd-code-generator`)
- Agent names: `lowercase` (e.g., `planner.md`)
- Commands: `kebab-case` (e.g., `init-project.md`)
- Templates: `PascalCase.template.md` (e.g., `SYSTEM.template.md`)

**Directory structure:**
```
.claude/
  agents/          # Agent prompts
  skills/          # Skill directories with SKILL.md
  commands/        # Slash command definitions
  templates/       # Document templates
```

## Testing Your Changes

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run `/init-project` successfully
- [ ] Run `/rapid-dev` on a small feature
- [ ] Verify all agents execute correctly
- [ ] Check artifacts are created in `docs/`
- [ ] Verify feedback loop works (builder-validator)
- [ ] Test with different tech stacks (Python, Node.js, etc.)

### Edge Cases to Test

- Missing `docs/SYSTEM.md` (first time usage)
- Validation failures (loop iterations)
- Breaking changes in code
- Large projects with many files
- Projects without tests
