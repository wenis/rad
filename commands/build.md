# Build Feature

Implement a feature from specifications by routing to the appropriate agent based on the build strategy.

## Usage

Use this command when you want to:
- Implement a feature from a spec
- Prototype a new idea quickly
- Refactor existing code
- Fix a bug

## How This Works

This command reads the spec to determine the build strategy, then routes to the appropriate agent:
- **Parallel strategy** ‚Üí Invoke orchestrator agent (coordinates multiple builders)
- **Sequential strategy** ‚Üí Invoke builder agent (builds directly)

## Instructions

**Follow these steps in order:**

### Step 1: Determine the Build Strategy

**If user provides a spec path:**

1. Read the spec file
2. Find the "Build Plan" or "Execution Strategy" section
3. Check the strategy:
   - If says "Parallel: N modules in M phases" ‚Üí Go to Step 2a (Orchestrator)
   - If says "Sequential: Single builder" ‚Üí Go to Step 2b (Builder)
   - If missing or unclear ‚Üí Default to Step 2b (Builder)

**If no spec provided (quick prototype):**

- Go directly to Step 2b (Builder)
- Builder will implement without formal spec

### Step 2a: Invoke Orchestrator Agent (Parallel Strategy)

**Use this EXACT minimal prompt:**

```
Orchestrate the build for docs/specs/{feature-name}.md
```

**That's it. Nothing else.**

The orchestrator will:
- Parse the build plan
- Spawn multiple builder agents in parallel
- Monitor their progress
- Coordinate validation loops
- Handle integration
- Report final status

**Example:**
```
User: "Build the user authentication feature"
You: [Read docs/specs/user-authentication.md]
You: [Find "Execution Strategy: Parallel (3 modules in 2 phases)"]
You: [Invoke orchestrator]

Prompt: "Orchestrate the build for docs/specs/user-authentication.md"
```

### Step 2b: Invoke Builder Agent (Sequential Strategy)

**Use this EXACT minimal prompt:**

```
Read the spec at docs/specs/{feature-name}.md and implement the feature.
```

**OR, if no spec:**

```
Implement {brief feature description from user}.
```

**That's it. Nothing else.**

The builder will:
- Read the spec
- Implement the feature
- Run basic smoke tests
- Report what was built

**Example:**
```
User: "Build the user profile page"
You: [Read docs/specs/user-profile.md]
You: [Find "Execution Strategy: Sequential"]
You: [Invoke builder]

Prompt: "Read the spec at docs/specs/user-profile.md and implement the feature."
```

### Step 3: Monitor and Report

After invoking the agent:

1. **Wait for completion**
2. **Review the output** (files created, what was built)
3. **Suggest next step** to user: "Ready for validation - run `/validate`"

---

## üö® CRITICAL: Minimal Prompts Only

**DO NOT add any of these to your agent prompts:**

- ‚ùå "You are the [agent] tasked with..." (no preambles)
- ‚ùå "## Current Context" sections (agents discover context themselves)
- ‚ùå "## Implementation Requirements" (requirements are in the spec)
- ‚ùå "## Guidelines" (agents know best practices)
- ‚ùå "## What to Return" (agents have their own output formats)
- ‚ùå Numbered implementation steps (agents plan their own approach)
- ‚ùå Interpretation of spec contents (let agents read specs directly)

**Enforcement Checklist:**

Before invoking an agent, verify:
- [ ] Prompt is < 20 words
- [ ] Prompt only contains: "Orchestrate..." OR "Read the spec at...and implement..."
- [ ] NO additional context, guidelines, or instructions

**If your prompt fails ANY check ‚Üí DELETE IT and use the exact template above.**

## Validation Report Fixes

**If this is a fix iteration** (validator found issues):

1. Tell builder to read the validation report:
   ```
   Read validation report at docs/validation/{feature}-report.md and fix all issues.
   ```

2. Builder will:
   - Read the report
   - Fix specific issues
   - Report what was fixed

3. Then run `/validate` again

---

## Examples

<example>
**Scenario: Parallel build**

User: "Build the authentication feature we planned"

<steps>
1. Read docs/specs/authentication.md
2. Find: "Execution Strategy: Parallel (4 modules in 2 phases)"
3. Invoke orchestrator:
   Prompt: "Orchestrate the build for docs/specs/authentication.md"
4. Orchestrator spawns 4 builders, coordinates validation, handles integration
5. Report to user: "Feature complete. Ready for validation."
</steps>
</example>

<example>
**Scenario: Sequential build**

User: "Build the user profile page"

<steps>
1. Read docs/specs/user-profile.md
2. Find: "Execution Strategy: Sequential"
3. Invoke builder:
   Prompt: "Read the spec at docs/specs/user-profile.md and implement the feature."
4. Builder implements feature directly
5. Report to user: "Feature complete. Ready for validation."
</steps>
</example>

<example>
**Scenario: No spec (quick prototype)**

User: "Quickly prototype a settings page with dark mode toggle"

<steps>
1. No spec exists
2. Invoke builder directly:
   Prompt: "Implement a settings page with dark mode toggle."
3. Builder creates quick prototype
4. Report to user: "Prototype complete. Test it out."
</steps>
</example>

<example>
**Scenario: Fix validation issues**

User: "Fix the validation issues"

<steps>
1. Find validation report at docs/validation/auth-feature-report.md
2. Invoke builder:
   Prompt: "Read validation report at docs/validation/auth-feature-report.md and fix all issues."
3. Builder fixes issues
4. Report to user: "Issues fixed. Run `/validate` again."
</steps>
</example>

## Troubleshooting

**Problem: Not sure if build is parallel or sequential**

**Solution:** Read the spec. Look for "Execution Strategy" section. If unclear or missing, default to sequential (use builder).

**Problem: Orchestrator not spawning multiple builders**

**Solution:** Check that:
1. Spec says "Parallel" in execution strategy
2. You invoked orchestrator (not builder)
3. Your prompt was minimal (< 20 words)

**Problem: Build taking too long**

**Solution:**
- For parallel builds: Check orchestrator progress dashboard at `docs/progress/{feature}-build-progress.md`
- For sequential builds: Builder is working - wait for completion

---

## Next Steps

After building:
1. **Review code** with user if needed
2. **Run `/validate`** to test thoroughly
3. **If validation fails:** Run `/build` again (builder will read validation report)
4. **If validation passes:** Ready for deployment or `/rapid-dev` for full cycle
