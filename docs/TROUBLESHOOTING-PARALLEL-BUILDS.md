# Troubleshooting Parallel Builds

## Architecture: Commands Orchestrate, Not Agents

**IMPORTANT: There is no orchestrator agent.** The `/build` command itself orchestrates parallel builds.

**Why?** The Task tool (used to spawn sub-agents) is only available in the main conversation, not to spawned sub-agents. Therefore:
- ‚úÖ Commands can use Task (they run in main conversation)
- ‚ùå Agents cannot use Task (they ARE spawned via Task)

**Correct architecture:**
1. `/build` command reads spec
2. Command detects "Parallel: N modules" strategy
3. **Command itself** spawns parallel builders using Task tool
4. **Command** monitors, validates, and coordinates integration
5. **Command** reports final status

This troubleshooting guide helps diagnose parallel build issues.

## Quick Diagnosis

### Step 1: Check If Command Is Orchestrating

When you invoke `/build` on a parallel spec, the command should announce orchestration:

```
üìã PARALLEL BUILD ORCHESTRATION

Spec: docs/specs/SPEC-XXX.md
Strategy: Parallel (3 modules in 2 phases)

Phase 1: 3 modules (parallel)
- Module A: ...
- Module B: ...
- Module C: ...

Spawning 3 parallel builders for Phase 1 now...
```

**Then you should see multiple Task tool calls in ONE message.**

**What actually happened?**
- ‚úÖ Saw announcement + multiple Task calls ‚Üí Parallel orchestration working!
- ‚ùå Builder agent invoked instead ‚Üí Command isn't detecting parallel strategy
- ‚ùå No Task calls after announcement ‚Üí Command trying to delegate to agent (old architecture)

### Step 2: Check the Command Logic

The `/build` command should:
1. Read the spec file
2. Find "Execution Strategy" section
3. If "Parallel: N modules" detected:
   - Announce orchestration plan
   - Use Task tool to spawn parallel builders
   - Monitor and coordinate validation
4. If "Sequential" detected:
   - Invoke builder agent directly

**Did the command read the spec first?**
- ‚úÖ YES ‚Üí Command is working correctly
- ‚ùå NO ‚Üí Command may have skipped detection logic

### Step 3: Check the Spec

Open the spec file and look for the "Build Plan" or "Execution Strategy" section:

**Good (will trigger parallel):**
```markdown
## Build Plan

**Execution Strategy:** Parallel (3 modules in 2 phases)

### Phase 1: Foundation (Parallel)
- Module A: Base collector
- Module B: Parser
- Module C: Validator

### Phase 2: Integration
- Module D: Integration layer
```

**Bad (will be sequential):**
```markdown
## Build Plan

**Execution Strategy:** Sequential (single builder)
```

If the spec doesn't have "Parallel" in execution strategy, the builder will correctly use Direct Build Mode.

## The Fix

### If Problem is the Prompt (Steps 1-2)

Claude Code is adding extra context to the builder prompt. This was fixed in recent versions of RAD.

**Update your RAD system:**
1. Pull latest changes from RAD repo
2. Copy updated command files to your project's `.claude/commands/`
3. Try `/build` again

**Temporary workaround:**
Instead of using `/build`, invoke the builder agent directly:
```
@builder Read the spec at docs/specs/SPEC-XXX.md and implement the feature.
```

### If Problem is the Spec (Step 3)

The spec doesn't define a parallel execution strategy. Either:
1. The feature doesn't need parallel execution (this is correct behavior)
2. The planner didn't detect parallelization opportunity (re-run `/plan` with more detail)

## Expected Behavior

When a parallel build works correctly, you'll see:

```
üìã PARALLEL BUILD ORCHESTRATION

Spec: docs/specs/SPEC-XXX.md
Strategy: Parallel (3 modules in 2 phases)

Phase 1: 3 modules (parallel)
- Module A: Base collector
- Module B: Parser
- Module C: Validator

Spawning 3 parallel builders for Phase 1 now...
```

**Then immediately:** Multiple Task tool invocations in a SINGLE message:
```
Task 1: Build Module A
Task 2: Build Module B
Task 3: Build Module C
```

After builders complete, the command spawns validators, handles validation loops, spawns integration builder, and reports final status.

## What NOT to See

‚ùå **Builder agent invoked directly** - If you see `builder(Read the spec...)` for a parallel spec, the command isn't detecting the parallel strategy

‚ùå **Orchestrator agent invoked** - Old architecture; orchestrator agents can't actually spawn sub-agents (they don't have Task tool access)

‚ùå **Sequential builds for parallel spec** - Builder using Write/Edit directly without Task spawning indicates parallel detection failed

## Architecture Explanation

**Current Architecture (Correct):**
1. `/build` command reads spec
2. Command detects "Parallel: N modules" strategy
3. **Command itself** spawns parallel builders using Task tool
4. Command monitors completion, spawns validators, handles validation loops
5. Command spawns integration builder after all phases complete
6. Command reports final status

**Why commands orchestrate, not agents:**
- Task tool is ONLY available in main conversation
- Commands run in main conversation ‚Üí ‚úÖ Can use Task
- Agents are spawned via Task ‚Üí ‚ùå Cannot spawn other agents

**Old Architecture (Broken):**
- Command delegated to orchestrator agent
- Orchestrator tried to spawn builders via Task
- Task not available to sub-agents ‚Üí orchestrator failed
- This is why orchestrator.md was removed

**Builder agent** (for sequential builds only):
- Invoked by command when "Sequential" strategy detected
- Reads spec, implements directly with Write/Edit
- Reports completion

## How to Prevent This

When writing custom commands for parallel workflows:

**‚úÖ Correct approach (commands orchestrate):**
```markdown
1. Read the spec file
2. Find "Execution Strategy" section
3. If "Parallel" ‚Üí Command uses Task tool to spawn parallel builders
4. If "Sequential" ‚Üí Command invokes builder agent
5. Command monitors, validates, and coordinates
```

**‚ùå Wrong approach (delegating to agent):**
```markdown
1. Read spec, detect parallel
2. Invoke orchestrator agent to handle it
3. Orchestrator fails (no Task access)
4. Falls back to sequential or fails completely
```

**Key principle:** Only the main conversation (commands) can use Task tool. Agents spawned via Task cannot spawn other agents.

**Command responsibilities for parallel builds:**
- Read specs and detect strategy
- Parse build plan (phases, modules, dependencies)
- Spawn parallel builders using Task tool
- Monitor completion
- Spawn validators immediately
- Handle validation loops (max 3 iterations)
- Spawn integration builder
- Report final status

**Agent responsibilities:**
- **Builder:** Implement individual modules or complete features
- **Validator:** Test features and create validation reports
- **Planner:** Design features and create specs
- **Shipper:** Deploy and monitor features

## Testing the Fix

After updating RAD commands, test with a parallel spec:

1. Create or use an existing spec with parallel strategy
2. Run `/build docs/specs/{spec-name}.md`
3. **Verify command reads the spec** - Should see: `Read(docs/specs/...)`
4. **Verify command detects parallel** - Should output: `Strategy: Parallel (N modules in M phases)`
5. **Verify command announces orchestration** - Should see:
   ```
   üìã PARALLEL BUILD ORCHESTRATION
   Spawning N parallel builders for Phase 1 now...
   ```
6. **Verify multiple Task calls in ONE message** - Should see:
   ```
   Task 1: Build Module A
   Task 2: Build Module B
   Task 3: Build Module C
   ```
7. **Verify NO orchestrator agent invoked** - Should NOT see: `orchestrator(...)`
8. **Verify command continues monitoring** - Should see validators spawned after builders complete
