# Coding Standards

This directory contains coding standards and conventions for the project.

## What Goes Here?

Standards documents that help maintain consistency across the codebase:
- API conventions (endpoint structure, error formats)
- Database conventions (naming, migrations)
- Testing standards (what to test, coverage targets)
- Code style guides (beyond linting)
- Security practices
- Performance guidelines

## When to Create Standards

Create standards documents when:
- Team grows beyond 3 people
- Inconsistencies emerge across features
- Onboarding new developers
- After identifying patterns worth codifying

**Don't create standards prematurely** - let patterns emerge naturally first.

## Standards Index

*No standards yet - these will be created as needed when the team grows or patterns emerge*

## Example Standards You Might Create

- `api-conventions.md` - REST endpoint patterns, pagination, filtering
- `database-conventions.md` - Table naming, indexes, migrations
- `testing-standards.md` - Test organization, naming, coverage
- `security-practices.md` - Auth patterns, input validation, secrets management
- `code-review-checklist.md` - What to look for in reviews

Standards should be concise (1-2 pages) and actionable.
