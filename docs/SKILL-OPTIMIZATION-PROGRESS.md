# Skill Optimization Progress

**Last Updated:** Current session - state-management-architect optimization complete
**Status:** 🎉 PHASE 1 COMPLETE! (7 of 7 heavy skills done!)

## What We've Accomplished

### ✅ Fixed Critical Bug: Agents Missing Skill Tool Access
- **Problem:** Only orchestrator had `Skill` tool - other agents couldn't use skills
- **Solution:** User added `Skill` to builder, planner, validator, shipper tools
- **Result:** All 5 agents can now discover and invoke skills ✅

### ✅ Established Progressive Disclosure Pattern
- Created pattern for reducing bloated skills while preserving content
- Tested with graphql-schema-designer (781 → 401 lines)

## Current Plan: Progressive Disclosure for All Skills

**Decision:** Keep all 34 skills, use progressive disclosure instead of removing.

### Skill Categories

**Category 1: Heavy Progressive Disclosure (7 skills, 700+ lines)** 🎉 **ALL COMPLETE!**

---

## The Pattern (For Next Session)

### Progressive Disclosure Structure

**For skills 700+ lines (Heavy):**

1. **Create directory structure:**
```bash
mkdir -p skills/[skill-name]/examples
mkdir -p skills/[skill-name]/templates
mkdir -p skills/[skill-name]/reference
```

2. **Extract content to separate files:**
- Framework-specific examples → `examples/[framework]-[topic].md`
- Platform-specific guides → `examples/[platform]-setup.md`
- Detailed configurations → `reference/[topic].md`
- Reusable templates → `templates/[name].[ext]`

3. **Trim skill.md to 350-400 lines:**
- Keep: Overview (50 lines)
- Keep: When to use (20 lines)
- Keep: One simple example (50-100 lines)
- Keep: Core instructions (100 lines)
- Keep: Pointers to detailed files (50 lines)
- Keep: Best practices (50 lines)
- Keep: Constraints (30 lines)
- Remove: All detailed/framework-specific content (moved to examples/)

4. **Add pointers in skill.md:**
```markdown
## Detailed Implementation Guides

For framework-specific implementations, see:
- **TypeScript/Node.js:** `examples/typescript-setup.md`
- **Python:** `examples/python-setup.md`
- **Advanced patterns:** `examples/advanced-patterns.md`
```

### Example: graphql-schema-designer Pattern

**Original skill.md sections (781 lines):**
- GraphQL Basics
- Apollo Server setup (TypeScript) - 150 lines
- Strawberry setup (Python) - 120 lines
- N+1 Problem explanation - 130 lines
- Pagination patterns - 75 lines
- Subscriptions - 40 lines
- Apollo Federation - 85 lines
- Security - 60 lines
- Code generation - 20 lines
- Testing - 30 lines
- Best practices - 40 lines
- Constraints - 30 lines

**After progressive disclosure (401 lines):**
- GraphQL Basics (kept)
- Basic resolver pattern (kept)
- N+1 Problem basics (kept, 30 lines)
- Pointer to `examples/apollo-server.md` (TypeScript moved)
- Pointer to `examples/n+1-prevention.md` (detailed DataLoader moved)
- Pointer to `examples/federation.md` (microservices moved)
- Pointers to other examples (pagination, subscriptions, security)
- Core instructions (kept)
- Common patterns (kept)
- Best practices (kept)
- Testing basics (kept)
- Constraints (kept)

**Files created:**
- `examples/apollo-server.md` (~150 lines) - Complete TypeScript setup
- `examples/n+1-prevention.md` (~120 lines) - Detailed DataLoader patterns
- `examples/federation.md` (~100 lines) - Microservices architecture

**Total lines:** Still ~771 lines of content, just organized better!
**Agent loads:** Only 401 lines unless it needs the advanced examples

---

## Next Steps (For Fresh Session)

### Phase 1: Complete Heavy Progressive Disclosure (6 remaining)

**Next skill to do: ci-cd-pipeline-builder (759 → 400)**

1. Create directories:
```bash
mkdir -p skills/ci-cd-pipeline-builder/examples
mkdir -p skills/ci-cd-pipeline-builder/templates
mkdir -p skills/ci-cd-pipeline-builder/reference
```

2. Read current skill.md, identify sections
3. Extract to separate files:
   - `examples/github-actions.md` - GitHub Actions setup
   - `examples/gitlab-ci.md` - GitLab CI setup
   - `examples/jenkins.md` - Jenkins setup
   - `templates/github-workflow.yml` - Basic workflow template
   - `templates/gitlab-ci.yml` - Basic GitLab template

4. Trim skill.md to 400 lines:
   - Keep overview + when to use
   - Keep one simple GitHub Actions example
   - Add pointers to other CI platforms
   - Keep core instructions
   - Keep best practices

5. Verify line count: `wc -l skill.md` should show ~400

**Then repeat for:**
- state-management-architect (677 → 400) - **FINAL HEAVY SKILL!**

### Phase 2: Moderate Progressive Disclosure (6 skills)

Apply same pattern but target 450 lines instead of 400.

### Phase 3: Light Progressive Disclosure (1 skill)

module-interface-generator - just extract advanced examples.

### Phase 4: Minor Trimming (7 skills)

Just remove redundancy, no restructuring needed.

### Phase 5: Description Improvements (All 34 skills)

Review and improve skill descriptions for auto-discovery.

---

## Time Estimates

- **Phase 1 (6 remaining):** ~6 hours (1 hour per skill)
- **Phase 2:** ~4 hours (40 min per skill)
- **Phase 3:** ~1 hour
- **Phase 4:** ~1 hour
- **Phase 5:** ~2 hours

**Total remaining:** ~14 hours

---

## Commands to Resume Work

### Check Progress
```bash
# See which skills are already optimized
find skills/*/examples -type d 2>/dev/null | sed 's|/examples||' | xargs -n1 basename

# Count lines in all skill.md files
for skill in skills/*/skill.md; do
  lines=$(wc -l < "$skill")
  name=$(dirname "$skill" | xargs basename)
  if [ $lines -gt 500 ]; then
    echo "❌ $name: $lines lines (over limit)"
  else
    echo "✅ $name: $lines lines"
  fi
done
```

### Continue with Next Skill
```bash
# Start with ci-cd-pipeline-builder
cd skills/ci-cd-pipeline-builder
mkdir -p examples templates reference

# Read the current skill
wc -l skill.md  # Should show 759

# After optimization, verify
wc -l skill.md  # Should show ~400
ls examples/    # Should show extracted files
```

---

## Success Criteria

When all work is complete:

✅ All 34 skills < 500 lines
✅ All agents have `Skill` tool access
✅ All skill descriptions are clear and specific
✅ Heavy skills use examples/ structure
✅ No content lost (moved to examples/)
✅ Skills are well-organized and maintainable
✅ Context window usage reduced by ~40%
✅ All skills follow Anthropic best practices

---

## Quick Reference

### Files to Check
- `docs/SKILL-OPTIMIZATION-PLAN.md` - Full detailed plan
- `docs/SKILL-AUDIT-FINAL-PLAN.md` - Original comprehensive plan
- `docs/SKILL-OPTIMIZATION-PROGRESS.md` - **THIS FILE** - Current status

### Key Decisions Made
1. ✅ Keep all 34 skills (no removals)
2. ✅ Use progressive disclosure pattern
3. ✅ All agents have Skill tool access
4. ✅ Target line counts:
   - Heavy (700+): → 400 lines
   - Moderate (600-700): → 450 lines
   - Light (540): → 400 lines
   - Minor (500-540): → 480 lines

### Pattern Established
See graphql-schema-designer for working example of progressive disclosure.
